Docker
· From https://docs.pact.io/getting_started/further_reading to https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm
    Then https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm#how-do-i-transport-my-pacts-from-consumers-to-providers to https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact_broker
        Then (Ctrl+F Docker Pact Broker) to https://hub.docker.com/r/dius/pact-broker/
            Then "Running with Docker Compose" ==> https://github.com/DiUS/pact_broker-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml

Oops!

$ docker-compose up
The program 'docker-compose' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
sudo apt install docker-compose


From https://github.com/docker/compose/releases ==> last version is 1.23.1, so:

https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose

$ sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.23.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
$ docker-compose --version
